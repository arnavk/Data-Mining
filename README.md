A version of the project is also deployed online at http://twitter-visualizer.herokuapp.com

It is a free heroku deployment and has limited memory resources and some operations may time out. For best results use the local deployment. If you encounter too many time-outs on the web application, please contact one of the group members. They will temporarily increase the memory capacity of the remote server.
